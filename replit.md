## System Architecture

The application follows a modern full-stack architecture with clear separation between frontend and backend:

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React with TypeScript using Vite as the build tool
- **UI Library**: Radix UI components with shadcn/ui styling system
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with CSS variables for theming
- **State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query) for server state management
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing

### Backend Architecture

- **Language**: TypeScript with ES modules
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Authentication**: Replit Auth with OpenID Connect
- **Session Management**: Express sessions with PostgreSQL store

## Key Components

### Authentication System
- **Provider**: Passport.js with Local Strategy for Railway deployment
- **Session Storage**: PostgreSQL-backed session store with connect-pg-simple
- **Security**: HTTP-only cookies with secure settings for production
- **User Management**: Email-based user registration with bcrypt password hashing
- **Login Method**: Email and password authentication with registration support
- **Password Reset**: Secure token-based password reset with email confirmation

### Database Schema
- **Users Table**: Stores user profile, Stripe customer info, and subscription status
- **QR Codes Table**: Stores QR code data with customization options
- **Sessions Table**: Manages user authentication sessions

### Subscription System
- **Provider**: Stripe for payment processing
- **Tiers**: 
  - Free ($0): 3 QR codes, 100 scans/month, basic generation
  - Pro ($9/month): Unlimited scans, branded QR codes, analytics, dynamic QR codes
  - Business ($29/month): Everything in Pro plus team features, bulk generation, custom domain
- **Features**: Plan-based access control, Stripe webhook integration, subscription metadata tracking

### QR Code Generation & Analytics
- **Dynamic QR Codes**: Editable destination URLs without regenerating QR code (redirect through /r/:id)

## Data Flow

1. **Authentication**: Users log in through Replit Auth, creating/updating user records
2. **QR Creation**: Frontend sends QR data to backend, which generates and stores the QR code
3. **Subscription**: Stripe handles payment processing and webhook updates for subscription status
4. **Access Control**: Backend enforces subscription limits before allowing QR code creation
5. **Analytics**: QR code scans are tracked and stored for user analytics

- **Environment**: Production PostgreSQL, Stripe integration, Gmail SMTP
- **Required Environment Variables**: 
  - DATABASE_URL (auto-provided by Railway PostgreSQL)

  - SESSION_SECRET for secure sessions
  - SMTP_HOST, SMTP_PORT, SMTP_USER, SMTP_PASS, SMTP_SECURE for Gmail

### Testing with Stripe
- **Test Mode**: Use test keys (sk_test_... and pk_test_...) in Railway environment
- **Test Cards**: Use 4242 4242 4242 4242 with any future expiry and CVC
- **Live Mode**: Only switch to live keys (sk_live_... and pk_live_...) for production
