# Railway Deployment Fix - QR Pro

## The Problem
Your Railway deployment shows the old basic QR generator, but your Replit environment has the advanced QR Pro platform with:
- Trackable QR codes with analytics
- Multi-niche business positioning
- Subscription system with Stripe
- Professional landing page
- Blog system with SEO
- Dashboard with analytics

## The Solution
Railway is deploying from an outdated version in your GitHub repository. Here's how to fix it:

### Option 1: Manual GitHub Push (Recommended)
1. Download/zip your current Replit project
2. Go to your GitHub repository: https://github.com/scot00671234/qrpro
3. Upload all files to replace the old version
4. Railway will automatically redeploy the new version

### Option 2: Use GitHub Personal Access Token
1. Go to GitHub Settings > Developer Settings > Personal Access Tokens
2. Create a new token with repo permissions
3. Use token instead of password for git push

### Current Status
- ✅ Your Replit version has all the advanced features
- ❌ Your Railway deployment is showing old version
- ❌ Git authentication blocking automatic push

### What Railway Will Deploy Next
Once updated, Railway will deploy your advanced QR Pro with:
- Modern landing page with video background
- "Trackable QR Codes for Real Businesses" messaging
- 3-tier pricing (Free/Pro $9/Business $29)
- Analytics dashboard
- Blog system with 6 SEO articles
