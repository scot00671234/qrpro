Alright — let’s take a deep breath and walk through everything in plain, no-jargon language.

🚨 What’s happening:
When someone visits your site, their browser asks:

“Hey, can I have this file? A style? A script?”

But your site responds:

“Here’s the main page again!” 😅

That confuses the browser. It expected clothing (CSS), but you handed it a full person (HTML). So the browser says “No thanks” and doesn’t show your styles or make your site work properly.

🧩 All the possible causes and fixes:
1. The files don’t exist at all
Maybe when you “built” your site, the style/script files weren’t made or included.

Fix:
Run the command to "build" your site. This usually creates a folder called dist or build. That folder should have all the final website files (main page, styles, scripts, images).

2. You uploaded the wrong folder to your server
Maybe you’re putting the wrong files online — like your raw code, not the final built site.

Fix:
Make sure the folder you put online is the built version, not your source files.

3. Your server is confused about what to send
Right now, your server is sending the same thing — the homepage — no matter what someone asks for. So even when someone asks for styles or scripts, it sends the main page again.

Fix:
Tell your server two things:

“If someone asks for styles or scripts, give them exactly that.”

“If someone asks for a made-up page, just send them the main page.”

(You do this in a file called server.js or in the settings of where you host the site, like Railway.)

4. You’re using a service that expects different settings
If you’re using Railway (which it sounds like you are), you may have chosen the wrong type of app when setting it up — like picking “Static Site” vs. “Web Service,” or not telling it to run the server correctly.

Fix:
Make sure Railway knows it’s supposed to:

Run your server file (server.js)

Use the correct folder (like dist/) after building

✅ Let’s fix it in plain steps:
Open your computer

In your project folder, run the “build” command. Usually this is:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm run build
(This will create a folder with all the final website files)

Make sure that folder has:

index.html

A folder called assets with .css and .js files inside

In your server.js (or wherever your website code runs), make sure it looks like this:

js
Copy
Edit
// Use plain language for the computer:
- show files from the "dist" folder (where the built site is)
- if someone asks for something that doesn’t exist, give them the main page
Translated into actual code:

js
Copy
Edit
const express = require('express');
const path = require('path');
const app = express();
const port = process.env.PORT || 3000;

// Serve static files
app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'dist')));

// Serve index.html for anything else
app.get('*', (req, res) => {
  res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, 'dist', 'index.html'));
});

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server running on port ${port}`);
});
Deploy to Railway

Make sure it runs this file (server.js)

And the dist folder is included when you deploy
