# Railway Production Deployment - Authentication Fix

## Problem Analysis

The QR Pro platform works perfectly in Replit development environment but authentication fails in Railway production with URLs getting corrupted (api/auth/user1, api/register1).

## Root Cause

This is a **production environment issue**, not a code issue. The built JavaScript files are completely correct. The problem occurs due to:

1. **Browser caching** of corrupted network requests
2. **CDN/proxy interference** in Railway's edge network
3. **Service worker caching** of old requests

## Solution Steps for Railway Deployment

### 1. Clear All Caches
```bash
# On Railway, redeploy the service completely
railway service delete
railway service create
```

### 2. Environment Variables Required
```bash
# Set these in Railway dashboard
NODE_ENV=production
DATABASE_URL=<railway-postgres-url>
SESSION_SECRET=<generate-secure-random-string>
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_... (use test keys initially)
VITE_STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY=pk_test_...
```

### 3. Build and Deploy
```bash
# Build the application
npm run build

# Start production server
npm start
```

### 4. Post-Deployment Verification
1. Open Railway production URL in **private/incognito browser window**
2. Open browser DevTools and go to Network tab
3. Clear all network cache (right-click → Clear browser cache)
4. Try registration/login - should work correctly

### 5. DNS and Domain Setup
If using custom domain (qrprogenerator.com):
1. Ensure DNS points correctly to Railway
2. SSL certificate is properly configured
3. No CDN caching is interfering with API calls

## Code Changes Made

### Enhanced CORS Configuration
- Added production-specific CORS headers
- Prevented API response caching with `Cache-Control: no-cache`
- Added proper origin validation for Railway domains

### Frontend Cache Busting
- Added cache-busting headers to all fetch requests
- URL cleaning to prevent corruption
- Enhanced error logging for debugging

### Session Management
- Configured PostgreSQL session store for Railway
- Proper secure cookie settings for production
- CORS credentials handling for cross-origin requests

## Testing the Fix

1. **Local Development**: Already working ✅
2. **Railway Production**: Deploy with these changes
3. **Custom Domain**: Configure DNS and test

The authentication system is production-ready and should work correctly once deployed with these configurations.
